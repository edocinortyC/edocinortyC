üëã Hey! Peter (or @cytronicoder) here. This is my alt account, conviniently named @redocinortyC. I mainly put any side projects/exercises here, while my biggest projects are put on display on my main account. ‚ú®

### Why?

I made this account so that my main account doesn't clutter up with the projects I am currently working on/have put on showcase.

### ü§ù Collaboration

I believe that collaborating on projects is a great way to learn from each other and build up experience; feel free to hit me up on Discord (cytronicoder#4975) or email me at [novodoodle@gmail.com](mailto:novodoodle@gmail.com) if you want to work on a project together.
